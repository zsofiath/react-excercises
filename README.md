In this repository I collect the react related excercises I've been doing.

# React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
[Udemy course excercises:](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
## 1. :construction_worker: User registerer
This is a simple form that adds new items to a user list. Only the name and the age is collected. It validates the form (none of the fields can be empty, and the age must be a positive number)
### Learned concepts:
* useState
* props, props.children
* components
* styling

## 2. :package: Food-order app:
This app simulates a food ordering system, where items can be added and removed from a cart.
### Learned concepts
* portal - *render certain elmeents in certain point of the DOM*
* context - *connect components that are not in parent-child relationship*
* reducer - *complex state management (dispatcher, actions, reducer)
* ref, forwardRef - *dom element reference, read only, it can be forwarded to the parent*
* useEffect - *this will not run every time the component is rendered*
